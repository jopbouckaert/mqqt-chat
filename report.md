**What is working and what is not?**

The chat client works.

**Was the assignment to hard or to easy? What was too hard or what was too easy**

I could choose how hard to make the assignment. But to make the chat client work I had no problems.


**For what part of the assignment did you need to do some research? (for example Google search)**

The styling part. I used google to know the keywords.


**How much time did you approximately spend on this assignment (excluding time of report)?**

16 hours.


**Is there any code you copied from someone else or from the Internet? Provide the source here (author, website, ...). Also explain what you changed to the source code.**

I did not copy code. I looked at other code to find ideas how to fix the problems.


**Is there a piece of code that you are not satisfied with. Place it here and describe what you think is wrong with it.**

I think the code is fine.


## Need to knows and remarks

I tried to make an login screen. I was able to switch te screens but I could not get data form the login screen to the chatclientcontroller. So I left this part out.
